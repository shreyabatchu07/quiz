This project is a simple responsive quiz application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The main goal of this project is to practice advanced CSS styling and JavaScript interactivity. The quiz displays one question at a time, automatically moves to the next question after an answer is selected, and shows the final score after completing all questions.
The project also demonstrates responsive design using media queries, ensuring the application works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Additionally, a public API is used to fetch and display a random joke dynamically using JavaScript.
This project was created as part of Task 3 – Advanced Styling and JavaScript during my internship to improve my front-end development skills.
